Email Utilities Module

This module is intended as an extension point for the application's email API.
Future enhancements may include:

- Sending welcome emails upon user registration.
- Sending password reset emails.
- Dispatching notifications or alerts via email.
- Integrating with third-party email services (e.g., SendGrid, Amazon SES, Mailgun).

Usage Example:
    from app.utils.email import send_welcome_email
    send_welcome_email(user_email)

Note:
    This file is currently empty and serves as a placeholder for future email-related utilities.
